In this repo, first an EDA will be uploaded and updated over the course of the remaining days of this challenge on Zindi.
My aim in the EDA is to simplify the problem as much as i can. I , personally, spent a few days struggling with the data and understanding the problem and this is a on-going process for me in order to decipher all the bits that would allow me to produce a good model for this data.
